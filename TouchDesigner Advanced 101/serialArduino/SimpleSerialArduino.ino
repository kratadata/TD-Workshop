  Proximity Sensing with the VCNL4040 IR based sensor

  License: This code is public domain but you buy me a beer if you use this and we meet someday (Beerware License).

  This example outputs IR, ambient and white light readings to the terminal.

  Along with proximity and ambient light sensing the VCNL4040 has a 'white light' 
  sensor as well. Point the sensor up and start the sketch. Then cover the 
  sensor with your hand. 
    IR readings increase as the reflected IR light increases
    Ambient light readings decrease as less ambient light can get to the sensor
    White light readings decrease as less white light is detected
  
  Hardware Connections:
  Attach the Qwiic Shield to your Arduino/Photon/ESP32 or other
  Plug the sensor onto the shield
  Serial.print it out at 9600 baud to serial monitor.
